**Survive your way through the dangerous cave filled with deadly enemies!**<br>
For that, you have brought a hook and a gun with you, but beware: each enemy you kill will revive, mightier than ever!

Our initial release v1 for the Game Jam features 6 levels and 3 enemies, both with increasing difficulty.<br>
Since then, changes were made here and there, check the 'Projects' tab above to see our progress.

jamshooter is made using [Godot](https://www.godotengine.org).
